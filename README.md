# LeesMaatje

LeesMaatje is a free and open-source browser extension that helps people with dyslexia read text on websites more easily by converting it to the OpenDyslexia font. This extension was created out of personal necessity and is designed to be simple, transparent, and privacy-friendly.

## Why OpenDyslexia?

OpenDyslexia is a font designed to improve readability for people with dyslexia by weighting the bottom of letters, making them more visually stable. This helps reduce letter-swapping and improves reading fluency. More about the research behind OpenDyslexia: [https://opendyslexic.org/related-research](https://opendyslexic.org/related-research).

## Privacy & Security

LeesMaatje is built with privacy in mind:

- **No tracking** – The extension does not collect or store any data.
- **No external connections** – It runs entirely in your browser without external servers.
- **Minimal permissions** – It only requires the ability to modify text styling to apply the OpenDyslexia font.

You can verify this by reviewing this repository.
